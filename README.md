==============

This is an introductory .NET project to demonstrate the basics of the SOA principles. The project is fully documented in a series of blog posts starting here: http://dotnetcodr.com/2013/12/16/a-model-soa-application-in-net-part-1-the-fundamentals/

You can use this project along with the description on the blog to get a basic understanding on the fundamentals of SOA and how it can be used in a simple .NET project.

You can also have this project as a starting point for your own project: tweak and modify it to fit your purposes.
